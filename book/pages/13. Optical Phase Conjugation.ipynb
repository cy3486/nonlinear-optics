    "## Description of Optical Phase Conjugation \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen from our study of stimulated Brillouin scattering that nonlinear processes can produce backwards waves.  Optical phase conjugation refers to cases in which those backwards wave are exact time-reversals of the original forward waves.  This is very different from a regular mirror.  For example, a beam that is focused just before a regular mirror would continue to expand after reflection, just travelling in the reverse direction.  A beam hitting a phase-conjugate mirror would re-focus back through the focal point.  How is this different from a parbolic mirror?  Well, in a parabolic mirror light doesn't retrace it's exact path, but instead bounces off the mirror twice in such a way that it's reflected path goes back through the focus, but through a different path. This is why the image is inverted.  In contrast, light hitting a phase-conjugate mirror does an exact 180$^\\circ$ turn as soon as it hits the mirror.  This way, the light beam's phase reverses at the reflection point and it traverses the same trajectory backwards.  For this reason, a phase-conjugate mirror is very useful in laser engineering, since any distortions accumulated by a forward propagating beam can be undone by travelling backward through the same abberations.\n",

    "## Real-Time Holography--phase conjugation by another name\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of optical phase conjugation turns out to be identical with holography.  Let's re-describe the process using hologrophy terms.  Suppose we have an image carred in some field $E_1$ whose amplitude and phase we would like to store in a material for later retrieval.  To store the image, we shine a reference beam $E_2$ on a holographic plate at the same time as the image.  The fields $E_2$ and $E_3$ interfere to write a grating on the holographic plate, which encodes the amplitude and phase of the interference pattern.  At some later time, we illuminate the grating with $E_3$, which is just a copy of the reference beam pointing in the opposite direction.  The field $E_3$ scatters from the grating to produce the original image, but in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference with optical phase-conjugation, of course, is that the grating is written in real time, nearly instaneously in fact.  The form of the grating is in fact just a polarization wave (electrons separated from their nuclei) that results from fields $E_2$ and $E_3$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the same real-time holography process can also be achieved by setting up an acoustic wave grating that the stores the phase and amplitude of two interfering beams.  In fact, this is exactly what happens in stimulated Brillouin Scattering!  The backward propogating wave is a phase conjugate wave.  However, there is a small caveat, since the stokes wave is shifted in frequency relative to the incident beam.  That means that it's not *exactly* the same and abberations will only be corrected for a limited path length.  Since the incident frequency and the conjugate wave frequency differ by about 1 part in 20,000, for a laser with a wavelenght of 1 $\\mu$m, no serious mismatch will occur for approximately 20 mm.  "
